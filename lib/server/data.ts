      <h3>SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test)</h3>

        <li><strong>Sections:</strong> Reading, Writing and Language, and Math (with and without calculator sections).</li>
        <li><strong>Total Score:</strong> 400-1600.</li>

      <h3>ACT (American College Testing)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sections:</strong> English, Math, Reading, Science, and an optional Writing (essay) section.</li>
        <li><strong>Total Score:</strong> 1-36 (composite score).</li>
