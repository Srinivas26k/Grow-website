      <p>Germany is a popular destination for international students due to its high-quality education, low tuition fees, and strong economy. Here's a survival guide to help you navigate student life in Germany:</p>
      <h3>Accommodation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Student Dormitories (Studentenwohnheim):</strong> Most affordable option, but apply early as demand is high.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared Apartments (WG - Wohngemeinschaft):</strong> Popular among students, offering a balance of privacy and social interaction.</li>
        <li><strong>Private Apartments:</strong> More expensive, but offer full independence.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cost of Living</h3>
      <p>Germany is relatively affordable compared to other Western European countries. Monthly expenses (excluding tuition) can range from €800 to €1,200, depending on the city and lifestyle. Key expenses include rent, food, health insurance, and public transport.</p>

      <h3>Culture & Social Life</h3>

      <h3>Working as a Student</h3>
      <p>International students from non-EU/EEA countries can work 120 full days or 240 half days per year. This can help cover living expenses.</p>
      <p>Embrace the experience, be open to new cultures, and enjoy your academic journey in Germany!</p>

      <p>Choosing between the SAT and ACT is a common dilemma for students applying to universities in the USA. Both are standardized tests designed to assess college readiness, but they have distinct differences. Understanding these can help you decide which test is right for you.</p>
      <h3>SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sections:</strong> Reading, Writing and Language, and Math (with and without calculator sections).</li>
        <li><strong>Total Score:</strong> 400-1600.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Emphasizes reasoning and problem-solving, with a strong focus on vocabulary in context.</li>
        <li><strong>Time per Question:</strong> More time per question compared to the ACT.</li>
        <li><strong>Science:</strong> No dedicated science section, but science-related passages appear in Reading and Writing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>ACT (American College Testing)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sections:</strong> English, Math, Reading, Science, and an optional Writing (essay) section.</li>
        <li><strong>Total Score:</strong> 1-36 (composite score).</li>
        <li><strong>Focus:</strong> More straightforward questions, testing knowledge learned in high school. Faster pace.</li>
        <li><strong>Time per Question:</strong> Less time per question compared to the SAT.</li>
        <li><strong>Science:</strong> Dedicated Science section testing interpretation and reasoning skills.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Which One Should You Take?</h3>
      <p>Consider these factors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> If you're strong in science and prefer a faster pace, ACT might be better. If you prefer more time per question and enjoy reasoning, SAT might suit you.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice Tests:</strong> Take a full-length practice test for both exams to see which format you're more comfortable with.</li>
        <li><strong>University Requirements:</strong> Most universities accept both tests equally. Check if any specific program has a preference.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ultimately, the best test for you is the one where you can achieve your highest score. Prepare well for your chosen exam!</p>
